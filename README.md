# hello-world
My name is Lauren aka LP


I am a Korean American from New Jersey. I have a passion for trying new things, especially activities and foods! Things I enjoy include yoga, live music, movies and spending time with family and friends. Currently my favorite thing to watch on the internet are typographers showcasing their craft and puppies playing in water.
